# Achieve JS

This project is all about creating examples that help you and me become proficient JavaScript developers at a basic level. I will aim to use the minimum amount of code necessary to achieve some fundamental goals, as recommended by trusted software engineers.  

## Some steps to follow towards mastering JavaScript

- Make a CRUD in JavaScript
- Make a JavaScript CLI
- Learn to create a JavaScript package
- Learn to consume a JavaScript package
- Learn to configure and update packages
- Learn to deploy JavaScript
- Learn to consume requests using JavaScript
- Learn to use databases in JavaScript
- Learn to handle files in JavaScript  
There are many winding paths to navigate in order to complete this journey. For example, you can use Node.js, React, or even Express.js to traverse some of these paths.

You will learn the details of the language as you deal with these things.
